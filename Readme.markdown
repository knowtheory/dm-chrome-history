Still a bit of a mess, for now just d/l and require everything in the lib directory, and you should have all the models you need to point to your chrome history.

WARNING: sqlite3 databases are easy to corrupt.  make a copy of your history and scan that.  Do not try and use your Chrome History while chrome is open.
